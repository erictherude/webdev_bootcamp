BOOLEAN OPERATORS

comparison operators:
>		greater than
>=		greater than or equal to
<		less than
<=		greater than or equal to
==		equal to
!=		not equal to
===		equal value and type
!==		not equal value and type

== performs type coercion, === does not
=== is best in most cases -more specific

logical operators:
(for x = 5 and y = 9)
&&		AND		x < 10 && x !== 5	FALSE
||		OR 		x < 10 || x !== 5	TRUE
!		NOT 	!(x === y)			TRUE
