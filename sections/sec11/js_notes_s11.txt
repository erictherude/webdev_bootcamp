BOOLEAN OPERATORS

Comparison Operators:
>		greater than
>=		greater than or equal to
<		less than
<=		greater than or equal to
==		equal to
!=		not equal to
===		equal value and type (strict equal to)
!==		not equal value and type (strict not equal to)

== performs type coercion, === does not
=== is best in most cases -more specific

Logical Operators:
(for x = 5 and y = 9)
&&		AND		x < 10 && x !== 5	FALSE
||		OR 		x < 10 || x !== 5	TRUE
!		NOT 	!(x === y)			TRUE



JS CONDITIONALS

IF, ELSE IF, ELSE

if(age < 18){
	console.log("Sorry, you are not old enough to enter.");
}

	console.log("You can enter, but you cannot drink.");
}
else {
	console.log("Come on in and have a drink!");
}
