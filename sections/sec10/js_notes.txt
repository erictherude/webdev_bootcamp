5 PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:
- numbers (4, 9.3, -10)
- strings ("Hello World", "43")
- boolean (true, false)
- null (null)
- undefined (undefined)

NUMBERS:
math operators
modulo (%) - remainder operator

STRINGS:
concatenation (+) - "charlie" + "brown" = "charliebrown"
escape character (\) - "He said, \"No way!\""
length (.length) - "hello world".length = 11
access character ([n]) - "hello"[0] = "h", "hello"[4] = "o"

EXERCISE 1:
//1
100 % 3 = 1

//2
("blah" + "blah")[6] = "a"

//3
"hello".length % "hi\\".length = 2



VARIABLES:
var variableName = myValue;
dynamic typing = you can change variable's data type after setting it
best practice: camel case variable names

new ways to create variables:
let - like var, but block-scoped
const - also block-scoped, but can't be reassigned

const > let > var
